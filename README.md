# About
I havent seen any non-super outdated Datapack mergers. They also look kinda sketchy, but maybe that's just me.

## Windows Tutorial:

Fast way: run the EXE file

Non-sketchy way: look through the .py code(or not) and press run

## Linux/MacOS:
If you are on linux, it should work because it's just python.
If you are still having issues installing, follow these steps:

Step 1: get Windows

Step 2: follow the Windows guide above


(BTW: yes, I am aware VirusTotal thinks the EXE is a virus, just run the .py)

### WARNING: Please do not run EXE files from strangers if you do not know what's in them. Proceed with caution when running ANY EXE.
